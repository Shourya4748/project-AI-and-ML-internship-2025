News Article Classification (Fake/Real)
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real. With the rise of misinformation online, automated tools that can detect fake news are increasingly important. Our system uses natural language processing techniques to analyze and categorize news content.

The dataset used contains thousands of labeled news articles, which are preprocessed by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing lemmatization. We convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, which helps the model identify significant words for classification.

A Logistic Regression model is trained on this data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that the model performs well in distinguishing fake news from real news.

For ease of use, the model is deployed through a web application built with Streamlit. Users can input news text directly into the app to receive real-time predictions on whether the article is fake or real.

This project demonstrates the effective combination of NLP and machine learning for tackling misinformation. Future work could involve experimenting with advanced deep learning models like LSTMs and transformers to improve accuracy and handle more complex language patterns.
